# weatherTrendsPipeline

An end-to-end data engineering, analysis, and machine learning project focusing on long-term climate trends in London, United Kingdom (2002â€“2024).

---

## Project Overview

This project builds a full data pipeline from API extraction to data transformation, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling (coming soon). It aims to showcase skills across **Data Engineering**, **Data Analysis**, and **Data Science**.

## Project Structure


---

## Current Progress

- [x] Extracted 20+ years of London weather data using Meteostat API
- [x] Built transformation pipeline with missing value handling 
- [ ] Completed first EDA (in progress)
- [ ] Build ML model for forecasting future trends

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for EDA
- **Git** + **GitHub** for version control
- **Virtual Environment (.venv)** for project isolation

---

## Goals

- Analyze Londonâ€™s long-term climate patterns
- Identify seasonal and yearly trends in temperature, rainfall, and wind speed
- Predict future climate metrics using Machine Learning (planned)
